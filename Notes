Difference between group by Key and reduce by key:

While both reducebykey and groupbykey will produce the same answer, 
the reduceByKey example works much better on a large dataset. 
That's because Spark knows it can combine output with a common key on each partition before shuffling the data.

On the other hand, when calling groupByKey - all the key-value pairs are shuffled around. 
This is a lot of unnessary data to being transferred over the network.
